This project was my first official and documented example of solving a problem with different softwares to create a workflow. Other than programming, I really enjoy working on cars. This is my 1988 Pontiac Fiero Formula I saved from South Tampa after it sat rotting for over 20 years. I was having driveability issues and had decided the best way to solve it was to come up with a way to tune it. I had an idea to use an EEPROM instead of the stock EPROM from the 80's, so I found a compatible chip, figured out the wiring to convert it to work with the Fiero ECU, and found a program to write those EEPROM chips with binary files. After scowering the internet, I was able to find a freeware version of GMEPro, an ECU tuning utility, and then a program to combine multiple binary files to let the user switch tune files.
